# Tic-tac-toe-game
This is a game I created using React. The rules of tic-tac-toe are simple. Each person takes a turn selecting a square on the board. Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'. The goal is to try and get three of your squares in a row. You can win by getting 3 in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
 ## Future Additions
 * Board Clearing Function for when someone wins
